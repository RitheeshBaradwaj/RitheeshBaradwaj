# Ritheesh Baradwaj
Hi there, I'm Ritheesh, a tech enthusiast who is intrigued by new-age technologies like Machine Learning, Signal processing, DevOps, so I try to learn them and apply those concepts in my projects. I'm also interested in AI and want to contribute my skills to automate the real-world problems for the betterment of Humanity. I'm a huge nerd/geek, spends most of the time on projects.

## My Articles
To share my knowledge and get feedback from expertise, I started contributing my work through blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@RitheeshBaradwaj). Reach out to my profile and provide your feedback 😄

## How I work
 I always belive in <i>Learning Together</i>. Created an GitHub organization <b>Developers Cosmos</b> 🌟,where we share information regarding new tech stack and build interesting projects which can be used in our day to day lives. My love for learning never stops, I wanted to stabalize myself as an individual in any domain that I am working on. The projects that I intend to make are the things that make me want to wake up in the morning. If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain 🙌.

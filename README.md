# Ritheesh Baradwaj
Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ritheesh, a tech enthusiast who is intrigued by new-age technologies like Machine Learning, Signal processing, DevOps, so I try to learn them and apply them in my projects ðŸ”­. I'm also interested in AI and want to contribute my skills to automate the real-world problems for the betterment of Humanity. ðŸ™Œ I'm a huge nerd/geek, spends most of time on projects ðŸ’•

## My Articles
To share my knowledge ðŸ’¡ and get feedback ðŸ’¬ from expertise, I started contributing my work through blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@RitheeshBaradwaj). Reach out my profile and provide your feedback ðŸ˜„

## How I work
 I always belive in <i>Learning Together</i>. Created an GitHub organization <b>Developers Cosmos</b> ðŸŒŸ,where we share information regarding new tech stack and build interesting projects which can be used in our day to day lives. âœ…  My love for learning never stops, I wanted to stabalize myself as an individual in any domain that I am working on ðŸ’». The projects that I intend to make are the things that make me want to wake up in the morning ðŸš€. If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain ðŸ™Œ.
